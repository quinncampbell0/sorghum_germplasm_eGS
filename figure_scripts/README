Scripts to create main text and supplemental figures

  figure1_script.R plots the heatmap and circos plot for Figure 1

  figure2_script.R plots the maps of Genomic Adaptive Capacity and Climate Resilience Score for Figure 2

  figure3_script.R plots the network map of germplasm provenance and germplasm storage location for global sorghum collections

  figureS1_script.R plots the standard variation of all environmental variables used in the study

  figureS2_script.R plots the genomic PCA across all study accessions, colored by region, race, and scores

  figureS3_script.R plots the results of the cross-validation across models and size of test sets

  figureS4-S5_script.R plots the results of hierarchical clustering on environmental variables, plotted by score, geography, and variable contribution (Figure S4), 
                        and also plots the botanical race of all accessions by geographical distribution and score (Figure S5)

  figureS6_script.R plots the Future Climate Resilience score against the Genomic Adaptive Capacity score

  figureS7_script.R plots the pairwise correlation between all environmental variables used in the study

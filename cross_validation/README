Scripts and data for performing cross validation of genomic selection models

  GS_allmodels_frac.R runs fractional cross-validation on each of four genomic selection models iteratively using 50%, 80%, and 90% of data as the test set

  GS_allmodels_kfold.R runs k-fold cross-validation on each of four genomic selection models iteratively using 2, 5, and 10 folds as the test set

  crossval_plotting_summarizing.R summarizes and plots the results of the cross-validations run by the two above scripts

  xval_frac_functions.R and xval_kfold_functions.R contain scripts for all the functions called in GS_all_models_frac.R and GS_allmodels_kfold.R

  xval_results_allmodels.csv contains the table of prediction accuracies from all cross-validations run in the above scripts
